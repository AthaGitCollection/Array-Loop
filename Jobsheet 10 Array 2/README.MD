# JOBSHET 10 ARRAY 2

## 2.1 Experiment 1 : Declare, initialize and display 2-Dimensional Array

1. You dont need to fill the array sequintaly from 0, but there will be no data, and if the data type is String it will be Null, Int/double will be 0
2. Because there is no name that i input in [3][1]
3. Done
4. audience.length = number of rows, audience[0].length = number of colomn in row 0, do they have the same length. yes, every row is created with 2 colomn
5. Done
6. Done
7. The advantage and disadvantages for each loop is more easier to write, and donet need to manage each index and for the disadvantages is cannot acces the index directly and cannot modify the array structure
8. the max row index is 4 rows
9. each row has 2 colomns with index 0 and 1
10. done
11. done
12. done
13. it combine multiple string into one single string 
14. done i already upload to github

## 2.2 Experiment 2 : Utilizing Scanners and Loops for input and Output on 2 dimnensional Arrays

1. No, you dont need to filled from 0th index, because the row and column is manually filled by the user, as the input is valid from the index is should be finr
2. Done
3. Done
4. Done
5. Done
6. Done

## 2.3 Experiment 3 : 2-Dimensional Array with Different Row Lengths

1. Done
2. turn array into readable string format
3. 0
4. Done
5. how to make length for each row the same u need to create new 2D array with equal row lengths
