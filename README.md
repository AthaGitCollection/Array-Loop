# Array-Loop
2.1 LAB 1 Answer Question :

1.There are 3 main components in FOR loop. Based on experiment 1 above, identify and explain these 3 components!
Answer : Initialization is used to initialize the loop control variable. Example: int i = 1;

Condition determines whether the loop will continue to run or stop. Example: i <= 50;

(Increment/Decrement) changes the value of the loop control variable after each iteration. Example: i++;

2.Explain how the following code works!
Answer : The code checks numbers from 1 to 50 using a for loop. If a number is a multiple of the input (i % multiple == 0), it adds that number to sum and increases counter by 1. So, it counts and adds all multiples of the given number between 1 and 50.

3.Done

2.2 LAB 2 : Show of multiplication of 2

1.Without if statement you can see on my repistory
2.i will give the screenshot of the program in the end of this README.md

2.3 Lab 3 : The Triangle
1.The program is modified to use a FOR loop instead of a WHILE loop.
A for loop is more compact because it places initialization, condition, and increment all in one line.
Both loops perform the same task, but using for makes the code shorter and easier to read.
2.The statement s += " *" means that the value " *" is added to the existing value of s.
It works because the += operator can be used for string concatenation in Java.
When used with strings, Java automatically combines the text rather than performing arithmetic operations.
